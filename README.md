# Hala! It's me, Hamed M. Alaa Farag.

I have been working with development since 2010. Started out and worked for almost 6 years as a .NET developer, but I found that my passion is building front-end stuff since 2016.

Nowadays, I am a full-time Lead Frontend Engineer @ **WakeCap** developing and maintaining products based on IoT technologies.

Fun fact about me, I am a color-blind person üòÅ.
